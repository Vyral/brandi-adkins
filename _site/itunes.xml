        <description>

Interest rates are the lowest they’ve been in the last two months, but are home prices still high? Are they going up? I’m going to answer both of these questions today.

Today, rates are at an average of 4.73%. At the beginning of November, that average was closer to 5.05%. That’s a change of around $70 per month on a monthly mortgage payment in our area.

Over the last two years, the housing shortage we’ve experienced has pushed up prices much higher than they should have gone. When you couple that with rising rates, it really pushed potential buyers to their limits. 

“Although home prices are gaining, those gains are shrinking.”

So although home prices are high and are gaining, you should also know that the gains are shrinking. More homes are coming on the market, so if rates can stay low, we’ll see more buyers coming into the market. This bodes well for our market’s future.

If you have any questions about the current market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

It can be easy to think your home is worth more than it actually is—after all, you’re proud of your home and you know buyers will love it just like you do! Unfortunately, this does not translate well to the market, and overpriced homes tend to sit, unsold, until price reductions are made.

This recently happened when a client and I made an offer on a home that had been sitting on the market for 47 days. It took a little bit—we had to get with the lender, talk pricing, etc., and by the time we made our offer, there were two other offers, as well. Why were there suddenly multiple offers after 47 days? The home had a reduction that put it in line with neighborhood prices. Before, it had been $14,000 higher than comparable homes.

“Overpriced homes tend to sit, unsold, until price reductions are made.”

When the price became appropriate, the buyers came. 

Sellers, you can enjoy bidding wars from the outset if you simply price your home correctly. Buyers, don’t write off a home that’s overpriced—wait for the eventual price reductions that are bound to happen. When it matches the price of comparable homes, make sure you have everything lined up so that you’re ready to pounce.

If you’re looking to buy or sell, have any questions, or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

As we wrap up 2018 and begin to set our sights on the new year ahead, planning for changes already underway, or soon-to-be underway, is so important—I like to consider it “assessing the situation.” 

Maybe your family is outgrowing your home, you have children going off to college or relatives moving in, or it’s time to sell a property you no longer wish to maintain. Whatever the reason may be, now is the time to prepare. 

“Being prepared means having a blueprint for when that moment comes.”

It could be that you’re looking forward to making an earnest offer on a home that’s right for you as soon as it hits the market. Being prepared means having a blueprint for when that moment comes—having the approval in place, knowing average days on market for the area, and what you’ll net to roll into the next house would all be part of that blueprint. 

Life-changing (and life-defining) decisions such as this require proper preparation, so be prepared and in the know sooner rather than later. 

I’m here to help you prepare for these most critical real estate decisions. If you have any questions or need guidance in preparing for the future, please give me a call!

        <description>

The zero down payment program is back! Deals like this disappear when enough people use the program, so it’s a good idea to act soon if you’re interested. All you need to do is meet a few requirements. Here’s what you need to qualify:


  Make $85,000 or less per year. They’ve also increased the maximum purchase price of a home to $350,000.
  Have a credit score of at least 600. Keep in mind, we can help you raise your score quickly if you don’t currently meet this requirement.


“Many people are going to be able to take advantage of the program.”

And that’s it! We believe many people are going to be able to take advantage of the program and buy a home for nothing down. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

With labor and lots in short supply, home prices continuing to rise, and demand remaining strong thanks to job and population growth, this year’s housing market in Central Texas is looking much like last year’s.

But you don’t need to take my word for it. During the annual housing forecasting event earlier this year, real estate expert Eldon Rude, who has been tracking the entire Austin area market for more than three decades, shared this same assessment. 

“As 2018 draws to a close and we head into the next year, we can expect our market to continue its recent upward trend.”

As I mentioned earlier, job growth has played a major role in the strength of demand in our Central Texas housing market. And with an average 27,300 new jobs coming to our area each year, it’s no wonder why this is the case. Even tech giants like Google and Facebook have been contributing to this growth. 

The bottom line is this: As 2018 draws to a close and we head into the next year, we can expect our market to continue its recent upward trend. With that in mind, though, area buyers, sellers, and homeowners should also be aware that interest rates are on the rise, as well. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like our team’s assistance in interpreting how these factors might impact your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon
