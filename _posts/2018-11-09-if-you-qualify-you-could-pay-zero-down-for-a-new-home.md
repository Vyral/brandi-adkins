The zero down payment program is back! Deals like this disappear when enough people use the program, so it’s a good idea to act soon if you’re interested. All you need to do is meet a few requirements. **Here’s what you need to qualify:**

* **Make $85,000 or less per year.** They’ve also increased the maximum purchase price of a home to $350,000.
* **Have a credit score of at least 600.** Keep in mind, we can help you raise your score quickly if you don’t currently meet this requirement.

**And that’s it!** We believe many people are going to be able to take advantage of the program and buy a home for nothing down. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
