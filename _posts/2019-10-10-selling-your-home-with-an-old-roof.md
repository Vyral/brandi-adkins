I currently have a listing where the seller’s roof is 18 years old. **It’s going to be difficult for the new buyers to insure an old roof**. So, we had a roofer that I trust go out and take a look at it. We wanted to see if there was any hail damage, or if its repairability or insurability was beyond the point that anything can be done. On a roof that age, when you’re making small repairs and patches, you’re actually damaging the roof even further because you’re disrupting the structure of what’s already there.

The roofer said the roof looked decent enough that we should have an adjuster from the insurance company come out to let us know whether that roof can be replaced. Sellers: If you have a roof that may be at the end of its lifespan, have an adjuster come and check it out. With some roofers, they can have that repair scheduled for when there’s a contract on the house. Then, that deductible could be paid at closing. So **you can get a roof put on your home before closing and having your insurance pay for the majority of it**.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via phone or email, I’d love to speak with you.
